# Tests

## Run
Note: Make sure **pytest** is installed in the virtual environment.

### Ideal
* Open the project in PyCharm. In the navigation bar, go to File -> Settings
* Search for "test" in the search bar
* Under Tools -> Python Integrated Tools, set the default test runner to **py.test**
* Right-click on the **_tests** directory and select "Run py.test in _tests"

### Alternative
To run the tests, `cd` into the project directory and simply run the command `pytest` in the terminal.
