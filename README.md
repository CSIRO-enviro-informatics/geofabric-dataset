# Geofabric-LD
A 2nd generation Linked Data API for the Geofabric.

From the [Bureau of Meteorology's Geofabric web page](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/geofabric/):
*The Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric) is a specialised Geographic Information System (GIS).
It registers the spatial relationships between important hydrological features such as rivers, water bodies, aquifers
and monitoring points.*

This dataset is a [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) version of the Geofabric.
